                Hello hello hello! Welcome to our devblog! First off, I wanted to say congratulations to everyone, second off, I wanted to complain 
                about some email-related issues, yesterday I recieved the same e-mail not once, not twice but SEVEN times! What?! Some people!
                <br><br>
                But in a more serious matter, we have finally managed to create this Devblog where we will (try) to periodically write updates
                on how we in the different teams are progressing. We have also finally been able to visit the Tromb office where we occupied two 
                conference rooms, stole coffee and fika and did some planning and thinking and listened to some beautiful drilling. 
                <br><br>
                What have the other teams been doing? The backenders have looked into some technologies and solutions to setup a backend. 
                The others have been working on detailing a design document, and planning how we want to progress further.
                <br><br>
                Next up for us front-liners is more planning, some asset-hunting and hopefully some more progress.
                <br> <br>
