            Sprint 1 is over and we have a working demo. Right now our group leader is holding a demo for Tromb \
            with the other group leaders to show our progress. Tomorrow we will show the demo to Peter and the class. \
            What we have right now is basically a front page with a leaderboard, 2 buttons and a temporary logo. The buttons leads \
            to a page with a game board where you can actually play tetris and then there\'s also some \
            back end stuff done that I don\'t really know anything about. It\'s not perfect but it is a working demo :) \
            <br> <br>\
            Next up we will have a meeting within the front end group to plan and decide what we want to accomplish sprint 2. <br>\
            (Also note to ourselves -> please upload a blog post with a cool video of a demo soon, I\'m looking at you Oskar &#128064;)\
