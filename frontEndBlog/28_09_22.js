            Since last post we front-enders have worked with the design of the startpage and the page with the game board.\
            We have also tried to get flutter up and running which has proved to be a bit diffult on some computers.\
            Those of us with working flutter setups have started to learn and experiment with it \
            so that we can hopefully get a prototype up sometime in the close future :)\
            <br> <br>\
            Here are our current designs: <br>\
