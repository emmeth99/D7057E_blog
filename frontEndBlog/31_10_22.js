            Whats this? Two new blogposts in a row after a long period of silence, I can feel a change in the wind, a new sprint must be coming. \
            <br><br>\
            We\'re finally done with Sprint 2 in which we made great strides towards our final goals, I\'ve been adding a bunch of new features to the \
            page with the single player game such as rendering of the upcoming and held blocks, some fun stuff like scores. The other frontliners have \
            been working on cool stuff like leaderboards, sound and profile page stuff, fun! We\'ve also cooked up some new designs for some new pages \
            that you might get to see in the future! As for the ever-looming multiplayer aspect of our game, we in the frontend group are mostly ready \
            actually. We even have a working frame for a multiplayer page, now we just need to get some more information from the backend and we\'re all set! \
            <br><br>\
            Today we also did some planning for sprint 3, held a super intense demo for Tromb, and got the super insightful \"Snyggt! Jag tycker alla funkar &#128077\" \
            feedback on our 9 different proposed logos\.\.\.\

            Oh, and here\'s that demo video Emma promised I would upload last time, oops &#128517!\
            You\'ll have to imagine your own Korobeiniki music though. Also please ignore the bugs :)<br><br>\
