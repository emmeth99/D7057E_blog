            After some problems we finally have set up a VM on Ludd with at public IP,\
            the link for the backend server is <a href="http://130.240.202.95:7351"> http://130.240.202.95:7351</a> when it is on.\
            <br>\
            The next step is to develop a POC for a client to communicate with the server.\
