      This is the beginning of sprint 2 for gameDev. Here the goal is to break eveyrthing we have created and destroy it.\
      <br><br>\
      During sprint 1 we wanted to get a working prototype upp. The goal was to have a game which had the simple implementations\
       which exists within the normal tetris. With rotations, with movement, with clear block. However, we aren\'t that happy \
       with the code. We want to spend our time with refactorying. Break large methords into smaller and split functionalitys from \
       places where there shouldn\'t be.\
       <br><br>\
      However, we have other plans for the sprint other then refactoring. We will create the store functions for the blocks, \
      be able to se the score we have accuried. Then we also want to solve some bugs which currently exist within the code.\
      Then most of all, add the functionality of the special tile block. This is so that we can have a block such as tromb \
      giving speciall effects.\
