      During sprint 2 our team has done a lot of work refactoring the code. Turns out bad code does not get better when left alone :P, but nevertheless we persevered. \
      Apart from refactoring, we also implemented important key features to the game logic in tetris. For instance now there is a way for frontend to see the upcoming \
      blocks, a way of holding a block, having a way to see if the game has ended and much more.\
      Also we have looked alot more on multiplayer this sprint and while we did not manage to finish it, we did build the groundwork for implementing it in sprint 3. \
      Sprinkle in some bugfixing, some merge conflicts, and an exam period, then you pretty much have the entire sprint 2 in a nutshell. Overall it went pretty well \
      especcially considering the exam period taking up alot of time for some group members. The most difficult thing during this sprint has probably thinking about \
      how to best connect all of the different parts aswell as thinking about how to write good code instead of bad code. \
      <br><br>\
      But now we are starting sprint 3 and this time we actually have some sprint goals(we kind of forgot to write down sprint goals for sprint 2 other than just a \
      mutual consensus about what we should do) and looking to implement multiplayer, do some more refactoring(yes, because we love refactoring), look at how we can deploy \
      a minimum viable product onto a webbserver and lastly fixing bugs/fixing perfomance issues.
