      During sprint 1 the group has set up a working tetris game.\
      A game where you can place, rotate, and move blocks while also being able to clear rows when blocks are placed.\
      This is now visable due to the work of frontEnd, where they call the tick state within gamedev to do what is needed.\
      <br><br>\
      We have had some problems early on where we had nothing for the team mates to do. This was mainly done due to bad\
      sprint 1 planing. The plan is to improve this on sprint 2 planing meating. Rather create more issues then less.\
      The we have also found a couple of bugs during the game play. However, a large portion of them has been solved \
      during the process. Multiple rows deleted when only one should have been deleted.\
      <br><br>\
      So after sprint 1, we will take the things we have learned and improve for sprint 2. Continue to suport the team \
      if someone needs help. Then continue to improve the game with the goal to get better at the projekt\
