  On the day the GameDev group booked up a meeting at Trombs office. The plan for the day were to create a sprint for the comming week,\
  through the group went in another dirrection instead.\
  <br><br>\
  Durring the planing of the sprint everyone agreed that it would help knowing what is needed in terms of architeture. Do we need \
  a seperate handler for the input or just for the board and so on. As a result the group put their time on establishing the code \
  architecture base with possible future improvments. Then in the end spent the whole day working with that shotting up the sprint \
  plan to the 22th instead.\
  <br><br>\
  We ended up creating the following design.\

  With the following image one can hopefully have a start understanding of where the program is heading. \
  The through we had were to be focused on a object oriented program with the bord, input and the moveable object seperatly where \
  GameManeger has the gameloop keeoping it all together.\
  <br><br>\
  On top of this the group had descutsions with the other groups to better understand what should be priotiesed in sprint 1 for \
  them to have workable and testable enviroments. As a result the board is a main focus to that the frontend can start testing designs.\
